Synchronously recording from multiple cameras
*********************************************

To synchronously start recording from multiple players at once, you need to create a daisy chain of recorders.

Specifically, in the recorder options you can specify if the recorder should start recording when a specific other player starts recording by seting the ``Records with player #`` dropdown to the appropriate option.

So, if there are three players A, B, and C and it is desired that all three should start and stop recording at the same time. Then set recorder B to record with player A and recorder C to record with player B. Then, when you start and stop recording player A, the other two players will also simultaneously start and stop recording.
