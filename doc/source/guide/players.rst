Managing players
----------------

Filers2 can be configured with one or more "players" at any given time. A :ref:`player <player_root>` instance is associated with exactly one :ref:`video source <player_type>`, such as a camera, a streaming server, or a video file on disk. The player will display this video and can be configured to stream it out to a :ref:`recorder <recorder_control>`.

Adding/removing players
***********************

More than one video player can be playing at any time. To add a new player, press the add player button.

If a player is not needed anymore, it can be deleted from the grid by pressing the trash button. This will delete the player.

Players layout

The arrangements of the players in the grid can be changed, by changing the grid parameters.

For example it can be set to two columns with as many rows as needed. E.g. if there are 10 players, it'll be displayed as 5 rows and 2 columns.
