********************

For a given player, one must first select the type of camera that will be used by the player. In the player bar click the camera type dropdown menu.

This will list the available camera types. This example will use a WebCam!

To configure the selected player, click the settings button. That will open the selected playerâ€™s settings.

This specific player, supports either playing from a WebCam or replaying a video file. We'll select the WebCam option.

The player's settings can also be pinned to the window.

This will make it easier to configure and preview the camera.

If the picture needs to be re-oriented such as when the video camera is rotated, press the rotate button to visually rotate the picture in ninety degrees increments.

This will only rotate the image on the preview screen, but does not rotate the recorded video images, however.

When you're done with playing the camera's video, press the stop button to stop and close the camera.

The last camera image will remain on screen.
