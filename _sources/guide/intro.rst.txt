Introduction
------------

Filers2 is a tool that can play and record video from webcams and other media sources.

It supports playing typical USB-WebCams and webstreams. It can also play from cameras such the Flir or Thor scientific cameras.

Filers2 can also be set up to stream the video on a network to another Filers2 instance.

Fliers2 also supports playing and recording from multiple cameras at once, independently or synchronously.

Filers2 configuration
*********************

Closing Filers saves the current configuration of the program. This is saved in a file called ``Filers2App_config.yaml`` alongside the program.
The next time Filers2 is re-opened, it restores Filers2 from that file to its last configuration.
If there are issues with Filers2, close it, delete the configuration file, and start Filer2 again. This will start it cleanly.
